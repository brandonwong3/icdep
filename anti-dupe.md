# How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?

### For ensuring each card is received once and only once, we can attach some sort of unique identifier 
### on the top right corner of each card with a fraction indicating which number card they are receiving out of a set amount. 
### This is for each node and the recipient can ensure they receive a unique card. 
### This also allows for readability, as the recipient can piece together the message in order sent from multiple unique cards.
