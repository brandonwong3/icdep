# How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?

### Send to any individual on the whole UW campus
#### Have the card contain an identifier on the top left corner of the card, with a connection to the intended recipient on a prominent part of the card. This would include their full name, UW email, their UW ID.

### Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values
#### To identify any ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values, we can put a shape on a card differentiating the type of message. Circle indicating ASCII text, Triangle indicating Unicode text, and square indicating binary values.

### Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through
#### We can do this by assigning each node to their own unique identifier. Similar to class, the node would communicate when they receive and send the card. But this time, would document it as a logging system, so it will be known when and if the card passed through said node.
